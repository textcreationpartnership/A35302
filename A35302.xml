            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ſaid long ſince; (when after the death of King <hi>Philip,</hi> they ſaw his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſucceeding no leſs to his Father's Virtue and Valour, than to his Crown and Kingdom;) <hi>That their Nation had loſt nothing but the Body, not the Bravery of their Prince, nor chang'd its Monarch, but only the Man,</hi> (as <hi>Juſtin</hi> expreſses it:) The antient Family of the <hi>Titchbourns</hi> (which hath continued ſucceſſively famous in this Country, ſince the firſt coming in of the <hi>Saxons</hi>) may truly ſay at this preſent by a particular providence of Heaven; which depriving it of its worthy Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> hath ſupplyed his place with a Sir <hi>Henry</hi> (your no leſs worthy Self:) who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb facs="tcp:32486:3"/> as well to your parents Virtue, as to his Eſtate and Title; give us all, a moſt juſt and joyful occaſion to confeſs, that we have thereby ſuffer'd no notable change or detriment; ſince the ſame ſpirit of Prudence and Diſcretion, which appear'd in the Predeceſſor, continues in the conduct and comportment of the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. And ſurely, they who have at any time been preſent, (And who would not wiſh to be preſent at ſo ſignal a Ceremony? Which I here mention amongst the many Examples of the Fathers and Sons paralell'd conformity, to eternize the deſerved memory of ſo heroick a Charity:) at the great Dole, freely given to all far and near Commers, and annually distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted upon the 25 of <hi>March,</hi> (as a <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum,</hi> I doubt not, of the eeleſtial bounty) upon that Day, in which the greateſt Dole that e're was given, (the Bread, I mean, which Angels feed on,) was beſtow'd from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove on ſtarv'd mankind; cannot but admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly behold ſo exact a correſpondency of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of Gravity, of Government, between him who formerly perform'd this pious action, and your Self who now proſecutes it; as that the change appears in nothing but in the Perſon, and the difference is only diſtinguiſhable by the Countenance. This little I have ſaid, (and more I dare not, dreading the offence of your Modeſty,) is chiefly in relation to Gods Praiſe
<pb facs="tcp:32486:3"/> and Honor, who is the bountiful Author and Beſtower of all good Gifts and Bleſſings: For I well know, That your ſolid Humility ſuffers you not to Attribute to your ſelf more of all the high Favours which Nature and Heaven have liberally heap'd upon you, than the bare obligation, which is thereby increaſed, of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding more diligently to your Duty; and, ſhould I go about to give you the least ſhare of the Glory, I ſhould at once injure the divine Grace, and your Virtue. Wherefore to avoid the Cenſure of Indiſcretion, and the Suſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Flattery; and leſt I ſhould provoke you to indignation, upon pretence of ſeeking to pleaſe you; and finally, fearing that inſtead of offering you a Preſent, I might prepare for you a kind of Puniſhment: I will ſpare the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of running farther into the large field of your Praiſes, (which I plainly foreſee would prove as irksome to your moderation and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as it is unſutable to my cuſtom and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and which indeed you would more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly permit, than I could eaſily perform:) Contenting my ſelf only to mention what I may not well ſmother up in ſilence, as directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the deſign of this Dedication: which is, That the conſideration of your ſingular Piety to God, and ſincere Devotion to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Virgin Mother, hath caus'd me to fix my eyes upon your worthy Perſon, as ſeeming moſt
<pb facs="tcp:32486:4"/> proper to patronize this ſmall product of my pen, containing a Daily Exerciſe for all pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians, in order to a holy Life, and a happy Death;) both in regard of the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy between its Precepts and your Practice; and alſo in hopes, that your propos'd Example, may prove to others a powerful Motive of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing your imitation. Nor will I doubt of your favourable acceptance of theſe well meant endeavours: ſince what is defective in the Manner and faſhion, is abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the price and value of the Matter, by the profit and neceſſity of the Subject, and by the hearty and unfeigned affections of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer; who ceaſes not dayly to ſollicite the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs, that after a long continued <hi>Holy Life,</hi> you may finally arrive at a <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Death,</hi> which will be infallibly follow'd with the reward of an eternal <hi>Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and Immortality.</p>

            <p>THe good ſucceſs of the two former Editions of this dayly Exerciſe, hath given encouragement to this third. In which, (by good advice,) there are ſome Additions, ſome Defalkations, ſome Alterations.</p>
            <p>The Additions are, The Calender of the Chief of our Engliſh, Brittiſh, Iriſh and Scottiſh Saints, for each day in the year, with the time of their Deaths. The Exhortation to all pious Chriſtians, which is in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Book; and Several Prayers in the 14th Paragraf.</p>
            <p>The Defalkations are, The ſeven Penetential Pſalms Paraphras'd; which, (although they contain moſt pithy Acts of Devotion, and eſpecially of Contrition, yet thoſe being ſupplyed by many ſuch Acts throughout the whole work) it was judg'd fit to omit; as alſo the ſeveral unneceſſary Examinations of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſome other few Superfluities; leſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Pocket-Book ſhould have ſwell'd to an over-big Bulk.</p>
            <p>The Alterations, are chiefly <hi>of the You into Thou,</hi> in our addreſſes to the Divine Majeſty: For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that other Nations generally make uſe of that ſweeter and ſmoother manner of expreſſing themſelves in Prayer; yet I durſt not introduce it into our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, for fear of incurring the Cenſure of Novelty or Singularity.</p>
            <p>What elſe is diverſified either in the Manner, or in the Matter, will obviouſly appear to the devout Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; to whoſe Prayers the Compiler humbly commends himſelf.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Time is not yet come, but your Time is always ready:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <bibl>(ſays our Bleſſed Saviour, in St. John 7.6.)</bibl>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p n="1">1. AS if he ſhould ſay; <hi>The day of my own Death is in my own diſpoſition; but as for you, the time of your Death continually attends you:</hi> Its ſtroak is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable, and its ſurpriſal dangerous. If
<pb facs="tcp:32486:26"/> it ſeiſes on you whilſt you are in an evil eſtate, you are utterly loſt; on that <hi>Moment</hi> depends your Eternity of Bliſs or Bale: <hi>Happy Moment,</hi> if it find you well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Moment,</hi> if it catches you undiſpoſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From this Advertiſment of our dear Redeemer, we ought to draw a neceſſary <hi>Reſolution</hi> of being evermore in a <hi>Readineſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>our Time is always ready,</hi> and we know not the Day, the Hour, the Moment of Deaths ſummons. And this affords me a fit occaſion, (here at the entrance into this Book, which is to contain <hi>the chief pieces of Piety belonging to the practiſe of all Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,</hi>) to direct you, <hi>(devout Readers,)</hi> how to diſpoſe your ſelves dayly by your <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening Exerciſes,</hi> that Death may not find you unprovided. An affair ſurely of higheſt emportance, and therefore deſerving your moſt ſerious attention.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Why ſtand you here loytering all the day long!</hi> ſaid the Maſter of the family, (in the Parable of the Vinedreſſers,) to ſuch as he found at the Mid-day ſeaſon, ſtanding with folded arms, and following no manner of fruitful employment: But how much more cauſe hath our Creator, <hi>(repreſented by that Father of the family,)</hi> to reproach the major part of Chriſtians; who ſeeming ſo full of
<pb facs="tcp:32486:26"/> biſineſs in this world, ſtand idling all their time; and being evermore employed, never act any thing to the purpoſe. Their pains-taking proves altogether unprofitable; <hi>their Works are uſeleſs,</hi> (ſays the Prophet,) <hi>and they weary out themſelves in weaving Spiders Webbs</hi> Ambition takes up their time, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice employs them, Vanity entertains them, Senſuality embuſies them; They run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of breath after fooliſh Fancies and irregular Affections; They tire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to content their Carnal Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcences, their Irregular Paſſions, their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary Curioſities; And yet they can <hi>never,</hi> (Ah, deceiv'd Mortalls!) <hi>never</hi> ſatisfy their Deſires: It being impoſſible to ſettle ſuch Appetites, as have no certain Rule, no ſolid End, no fixed Aym and Pretenſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And what (I pray you,) is the Fruit of all their labours! What are all theſe paſſing things they ſo paſſionatly purſue, being compar'd to the <hi>Eternal good things</hi> they neglect, to <hi>God</hi> whom they forget, to <hi>Heaven</hi> which they forego! What are they but meer Flies, Atomes, Nothings, leſs than Nothings! And yet, O the vaſt number of ſuch buſie Idlers, and idle Laborers! What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever men act againſt <hi>Gods holy Law</hi> and Precepts; whatſoever they act being <hi>out of God Grace;</hi> whatſoever they act, not
<pb facs="tcp:32486:27"/> aiming at Gods honour by <hi>purity of Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> though they take never ſo much pains, yea though the Action have in it ſelf never ſo much of Moral Goodneſs; yet 'tis <hi>loſt</hi> as to the Doors, 'tis uſeleſs to their Souls, 'tis bootleſs for Heaven, 'tis nothing worth, as to the main aim of a Chriſtian and the final End of Man, which is Eternal Life, Eternal Felicity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis therefore a prudent Caution, and worthy every Chriſtians Conſideration, (who ought by Reaſon and may by Grace provide for his own good,) to be evermore careful, not only to Act nothing <hi>contrary</hi> to his Salvation, but nothing which <hi>conduces not</hi> thereto; that ſo he may not expend his Time, his Toil, his Talent, fooliſhly, idly, unprofitably. Now he ſhall happily hit this mark, who ſo orders the whol courſe of his Life, as [1.] <hi>to endeavour to keep himſelf always in Gods Grace and Favour;</hi> and [2] <hi>to relate all his Actions,</hi> (whether Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or Moral, or Natural,) <hi>to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty,</hi> either by an expreſs and particular adreſs of his Intention to his honour, or (at leaſt) by a tacite, vertual, general Deſignation, whereby he reſolv's and purpoſes to perform all his Actions to his Creators praiſe and glory; following the Apoſtles advice, <hi>Do all things to Gods Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:32486:27"/>
            <p n="6">6. And becauſe the whol courſe of our lives pilgrimage is compoſed of <hi>Years,</hi> the years of <hi>Months,</hi> the months of <hi>Weeks,</hi> the weeks of <hi>Days;</hi> He who ſhall duly ſettle his Courſe for the ſpace of <hi>each Days</hi> dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diligently obſerve a devout Rule for his Dayly conduct; cannot fail in the happy ſteerage of his whole life; wherein conſiſts the Chriſtians true Duty and tot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Occupation: and which ſurely is the beſt Preparation againſt that ſurpriſal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our preſent Theam threatens us; <hi>The time of our Death,</hi> (and of the Judgment which follows it,) <hi>is ever ready</hi> and at hand: The Time is certain as to the Execution, uncertain as to the Moment; and therefore it demands of us all, a Preparation, dayly renew'd, diligently continved, devoutly preſeverant.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Now to the end I may deliver this ſo uſeful and neceſſary an Inſtruction in due Order and Method: it ſhall be briefly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did into three Points.

                  <item>1. <hi>The Exerciſe for the Morning,</hi>
                  </item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Which I propoſe to you all <hi>(Devout Chriſtians!)</hi> not to be ſimply read, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:32486:28"/> laid aſide; but to be deeply imprinted in your Memories, and duly practiſed in your Lives and Actions, according to each ones reach and capacity, and as his leaſure will give him leave; <hi>(the ſeveral Callings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Affairs, and Employments of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, being conſidered.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Theſe Exerciſes therefore, are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary for all ſuch Chriſtians, as ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſpire to <hi>that End,</hi> which is the object of their Hope, whereto their Faith teaches them to tend; which is, <hi>the Eternal glory of the next Life.</hi> For he who neglects to left up his Heart to God in the <hi>days beginning,</hi> before he gives his affection to worldly affaires; ſhews an ungrateful forgetfulneſs of the <hi>End,</hi> to which each one ought to aſpire; and ſufficiently declares, that the irregular love of <hi>temporal things,</hi> hath ſtifled in his Soul all ſenſe of <hi>things Eternal:</hi> So likewiſe he who is careleſs in ſcanning over his Soul, and conſidering his condition at the <hi>Days ending;</hi> ſeems he not to have a Swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Spirit, which hath no motion but for the Body, no life but for the Belly! To paſs <hi>whol Days</hi> without any reſpect to God, or reflection on himſelf; but to caſt himſelf freely upon all occurring objects and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Vanity, Curioſity, Senſuality; if it is not a clear mark of Infidelity, 'tis
<pb facs="tcp:32486:28"/> certainly a manifeſt token of Folly, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, Beſtiality; and is ſurely one of the greateſt Negligences, which can poſſibly befal a Soul, pretending to any thing beyond this preſent Life.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>O Men!</hi> (cry's out the Prophet,) <hi>Make not your ſelves like Horſes and Mules, which are utterly devoid of all underſtanding:</hi> You have not Beaſt-like, <hi>Heads</hi> bended to the Earthwards; but yet if in your Bodies erected towards Heaven, you have <hi>Souls</hi> crouching only downwards; <hi>Souls,</hi> which neither look up in the <hi>Morning</hi> by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, nor in the <hi>Day time</hi> by a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, nor in the <hi>Evening</hi> by a Reflexion towards the place of its Origin; but whoſe continual Cogitations, Actions, Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, perpetually confine it to its own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; Wherein do you differ from Brute-Beaſts, except only in the ſhape of your erected Bodies; the ſtraightneſs whereof may juſtly upbraid the crookedneſs of your Spirits, and the wryneſs of your Reaſon. If you <hi>tend to God,</hi> why think you not of him; why ſend you not your dayly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions to ſalute the object of your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; why flies not your Heart frequently towards the place where your Treaſure is! <hi>O ſtrange diſorder!</hi> God is your <hi>End,</hi> and yet the World is your continual <hi>employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:32486:29"/>
            <p n="10">10. The <hi>Fruits of theſe Exerciſes</hi> are ſo great, that I may boldly ſay, It ſeems in ſome ſort impoſſible for ſuch a Soul, as carefully, punctually, preſeverantly pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes them, to be in danger of damnation: For by theſe dayly renewed Purpoſes and Reſolutions, ſhe gives herſelf dayly to the Divine Majeſty; and God hath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his own bleſſed promiſe, <hi>Not to abandon him who com's unto him, but to receive him into his Protection,</hi> till he ſhall admit him one day to the enjoyment of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But let's deſcend from <hi>Generals to Particulars,</hi> from Speculation to Practiſe: <hi>In the Morning ſeaſon,</hi> (ſaid the Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,) <hi>I will preſent my ſelf before thee,</hi> (my dread Soveraign!) <hi>and I will ſee</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what my duty is towards thee, and what thou deſireſt of me. God, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law, reſerv'd to himſelf <hi>the Firſt fruits of the Earth, and the Firſt born of Men and Beaſts:</hi> And with how much more reaſon, ſhould we Chriſtians render him the <hi>Firſt fruits of the day,</hi> the Firſt thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; which being formed after our morning Sleep, may be fitly named the <hi>Firſt born of our Hearts!</hi> And ſurely the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and wretchleſs Omiſſion of this Duty, draws after it a whol Deluge of defects,
<pb facs="tcp:32486:29"/> imperfections, failings, fallings, venial Sins, and ſomtimes mortal Crimes; into which they tumble headlong, who forgetting God, deſerve to be by him forgotten; and who in the <hi>Morning</hi> neglecting to demand his Succour, deſerve in the <hi>Day time</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of his Aſſiſtance in their ſeveral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters and occaſions.</p>
            <p n="12">12. If therefore <hi>(O Chriſtian!)</hi> thou haſt a deſire to preſerve thy ſelf from Sin; let it be thy firſt care, as ſoon as thy Eyes are unſeel'd from Sleep, to caſt them up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven; ſaying with the watchful Prophet; <hi>To thee,</hi> (O my Lord!) <hi>do I life up my Eyes, my Hands, my Heart, from this Bed, where my Body hath taken 'its nightly repoſe, towards thy Heaven, where my Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects her eternal reſt,</hi> &amp;c. And having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd thy Soul with ſuch like <hi>Elevations</hi> whilſt thou cloatheſt thy Body with its Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, retire into thy Cabinet; caſt thy ſelf reverently upon thy Knees, raiſe up thy Thoughts towards the glorious Deity, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg</hi> thy own Nothing, and <hi>adore</hi> his infinit Eſſence.</p>
            <p>Then ſecond this <hi>Act of Adoration</hi> with a conſideration of the large <hi>Benefits</hi> receiv'd from his liberal hand: The memory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (which are common to all mankind, and which being more remarkable in thy own
<pb facs="tcp:32486:30"/> particular than in divers others, muſt needs add weight to thy Obligation,) is a moſt powerful motive, to draw from thy affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionat Heart and Mouth, Acts of <hi>Praiſe and Gratitude</hi> towards thy bountiful Benefactor.</p>
            <p>Accompany this Act of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> with a <hi>Remembrance of thy former Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> which will lead thee on to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction and Contrition. Mark, how thou haſt perverted the Gifts of <hi>Nature,</hi> abuſed the Gifts of <hi>Fortune,</hi> rejected the proferr'd Gifts of <hi>Grace,</hi> contemn'd the promis'd Gifts of <hi>Glory.</hi> Caſt alſo a particular glance upon the moſt grievous Crimes of thy paſt Life, and reflect briefly on ſuch, as thou haſt fallen into ſince thy laſt Confeſſion; and excite a deep Confuſion in thy Soul for her ſtrange Diſloyalty.</p>
            <p>Let this <hi>Contrition</hi> be follow'd with a couragious <hi>Reſolution</hi> of Amending what is amiſs, and of Correſponding better to Gods Graces for the Future; and particularly of Employing the <hi>preſent Day</hi> to his honour and ſervice; ſaying with the Prophet: <hi>My Heart is prepared,</hi> (O my Lord God!) <hi>my Heart is prepared to perform its duty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>General Reſolution</hi> of well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the preſent Day; propoſe to thy ſelf in particular, thoſe <hi>Principal Actions and Affairs,</hi> wherein thou probably may'ſt
<pb facs="tcp:32486:30"/> be that Day engaged: and having ranked them in thy Mind according to their ſeveral Orders, aſſigning to each of them its proper Place, Time, and Meaſure; Offer them up to God with a pure Intention to ſeek his only honour in their Performance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all to his Providence, which will cauſe them to ſucceed to your Good and his Glory.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Conclude this Morning Exerciſe</hi> by humbly imploring thy Creators power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſſiſtance for the effectual performance of theſe thy pious Purpoſes; ſaying with the ſame devout Prophet; <hi>Keep my stepps in thy ſacred paths,</hi> (O Lord!) <hi>that my weak and ſtaggering Feet may not falter in the way of thy bleſſed Law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>A happy Beginning, is one half of the Work;</hi> and a Ship unmoor'd from the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, with a favourable Gale, and ful-ſwoll'n Sails; ſeems rather to fly than ſwim towards the intended Port: A Soul which hath ſo well entred upon her Days voyage, cannot but make a happy progreſs, following the ſame conduct of the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe gracious Inſpiration gave her this firſt good Motion: And it ordinarily fall's out with man's Heart, as with a <hi>Bowl,</hi> which contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues rowling along on the ſame ſide, on which he grounded it who firſt deliver'd it.
<pb facs="tcp:32486:31"/> If thy Heart, <hi>O Chriſtian!</hi> hath begun in the Morning to turn upon Heavens ſide; it will eaſily follow that Rut all the Day long; and though the Objects of Creatures, the Variety of worldly Affairs, the Neceſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Body, the Occupations of each ones Charge, Office, and Condition, and the ſeveral Accidents of the Active Life, will ly <hi>as Rubs in thy Way,</hi> to retard thy ſpeedy Courſe: yet they will not have the Power totally <hi>to stop thy tendency,</hi> nor eaſily remove thee from thy well made Reſolution. Thou wilt run through, by, or over all thou meetſt with; to meet with that deſired Object which is thy prime and principal Aym and Intention.</p>
            <p n="14">14. And now to ſet down a ſhort and eaſy Method whereby thou mayſt piouſly Regulate the <hi>whol Days</hi> courſe upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: having in the Morning made theſe good Purpoſes, practiſe in the day-time <hi>theſe Six Points.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> endeavour to obſerve exactly the formerly made Diviſion of the Days em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; executing each intended Action, at the Time, in the Manner, and with ſuch Conditions, Qualifications, Circumſtances, as you foreſaw and premeditated the ſame: Yet, no <hi>with a Spirit of Servitude,</hi> which tyes you to run over by Rote ſome anciently
<pb facs="tcp:32486:31"/> uſed Exerciſes; falling into diſquiet, when ſome unforeſeen Accident ſhall force you to deferr or interrupt your own prefix'd time and order: But with a free, peaceable, and pleaſant Spirit, which purſues the pre-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reſolution, (as far forth as the interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient occaſſions will permit,) ſweetly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ignedly, unconſtrainedly. For, to oblige ones ſelf ſo ſtrictly <hi>to any certain Method,</hi> as never to fail therein upon ſome urgent Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; nor to leave it, without the loſs of inward tranquillity: Is to render ones ſelf <hi>uſeleſs to his Neighbour,</hi> troubleſome to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, tireſome to all Company. But on the other ſide, to preſcribe <hi>no Rule</hi> for your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Practiſe, is to live in perpetual <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,</hi> and to expoſe your ſelf to all ſorts of hazards and Confuſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> At the entrance upon each Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, (which is of mom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t,) remember and renew that good purpoſe you formerly made of <hi>Referring all to Gods honour and glory.</hi> This may be don (as it were) in the twinkling of an Eye, by a ſecret, ſweet, and ſodain Glance of the Soul towards her Soveraign good: and is ſo far from over-buſying the Spirit; that it enables it with new activity, and alacrity to execute what it hath in hand. And this ſurely is one of the <hi>chief Secrets in Spirituality,</hi> whereby a Soul, which knows
<pb facs="tcp:32486:32"/> the right uſe thereof and practiſes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,) ſhall be ſure never to act any thing in vain, nor with regret; but to undertake all things with Cheerfulneſs and turn all her Actions to her Merit: Becauſe that Labour, which propoſes the Divine honour for its End; can neither be excluded from <hi>Comfort</hi> in its Proſecution, nor depriv'd of a <hi>Reward</hi> after its Performance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Fall not ſo eagerly and ardently upon any Exteriour Action, as to have your Heart <hi>wholly fix'd upon it.</hi> For, if the thing is <hi>Indifferent,</hi> this Exceſs may make it Evil: if <hi>Good,</hi> it muſt be don with due Meaſure, Moderation, Dirſcetion: moreover, during the heat of this Violence and Vehemency, Paſſion may ſtep into Reaſons place, and Evil may borrow the cloak and colour of Good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Examin all that occurs, before you give it entra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e into your <hi>Interiour;</hi> And if you find it evidently <hi>Evil,</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to Gods Law and Love; preſently and without diſpute, reject it, abandon it, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate it: If you find it <hi>Good,</hi> Lawful, Laudable; embrace it quietly, ſweetly, pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably: If you judg it to be a matter <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> behave your ſelf alſo Indifferently, without tying your ſelf to it by Affection, or turning from it by Averſion; becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:32486:32"/> there may be danger in either, <hi>there</hi> of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, <hi>here</hi> of Incivility. In brief, Uſe, Receive Refuſe all things, according to their own real Nature, Worth, and Merit: the <hi>Evil</hi> with Horrour, the <hi>Good</hi> with Honour, the <hi>Doubtful</hi> with Dread, the <hi>Indifferent</hi> with a diſcreet Freedom, <hi>All</hi> with Tranquillity of mind. And this is a moſt uſeful and eaſy Rule, to paſs the whol Day in Purity of Heart and Peace of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Return often into your Interiour, by making frequent Reflexions upon your ſelf, thereby to avoid your Enemies ſnares and ſurpriſals. This is the Exerciſe of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, the <hi>Rule of Rules,</hi> without which all the reſt will little advantage you; and which alone (well practiſed) contains All, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently may ſerve inſtead of All: Neither is it uneaſy to be by any one every where practiſed, without the leaſt hindrance of Affairs, or hurt of Converſation.</p>
            <p>But becauſe <hi>all our Good proceeds from God,</hi> The <hi>Sixth</hi> and laſt Point of this Inſtruction, is to entertain your Thoughts continually with the feeling of his ſweet and powerful <hi>Preſence in your Soul,</hi> by frequent and fervent Aſpirations and Jaculatory Prayers, either Vocal or Mental: Somtimes <hi>Invoking his Mercy;</hi> other times <hi>Adoring his Majeſty;</hi> now <hi>Thanking him,</hi> then <hi>Prayſing him;</hi> now
<pb facs="tcp:32486:33"/> 
               <hi>Complaining of your Miſery,</hi> frailty, folly; then <hi>Admiring his goodneſs,</hi> patience, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity; now being <hi>Sorrowful for your Sins,</hi> then making <hi>ſerious Reſolutions</hi> of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Thus varying your inward Acts and Affections, according to the diverſity of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, or to your Souls ſeveral Motions, or to the Holy Ghoſts Impulſes and In-actions.</p>
            <p>He who can ſweetly <hi>paſs over the Day</hi> in theſe pious Exerciſes, and have his Soul fix'd in Heaven, whilſt his Body is toſſed too and fro upon Earth; may <hi>(Halcyon like)</hi> find a real Calm upon the raging Sea, enjoy a quiet Peace in time of cruelleſt Warr; and remain unmov'd amidſt the greateſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts. <hi>Let there be thy Heart,</hi> ſays St Auguſtin, <hi>and here will be Reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. The Day thus happily ſliding away, draws on the Night-Seaſon; and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains yet an <hi>Evening Exerciſe</hi> in order to <hi>even your Accompts</hi> with the great Father of the Family, concerning your days labour in his <hi>Vinyard.</hi> And if this Self-Examination ſeem'd a matter of much importance to meer <hi>Phyloſophers,</hi> (as appears in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;) who aym'd only at the leading of a Moral, Diſcreet, and Rational Life; how much more neceſſary is it for <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are to lead a Holy, Spiritual, Angelical, Divine Life? I ſay, <hi>[a Divine Life:]</hi> For
<pb facs="tcp:32486:33"/> Chriſtians are invited by their Profeſſion, to imitate not only the Angels Purity, but their Creators Perfection; who hath propoſed himſelf the Pattern as well as the final End and Period of our earthly Pilgrimage: <hi>Be ye perfect,</hi> O Chriſtians (ſays our Saviour in the Goſpel) <hi>as your Heavenly Father is perfect.</hi> The Apoſtle intimates this Duty, as gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally belonging to all Chriſtians, when he ſays <hi>Let every one examin and prove his own works:</hi> And the Council of Trent commands every one, <hi>To Examin himſelf ſeriouſly, and to ſound the deepeſt ſecrets, the moſt hidden folds, the darkeſt corners of his Soul and Conſcience:</hi> Which Precept though it obliges only ſuch as preſent themſelues to the <hi>Sacrament of Penance;</hi> yet it may be alſo eſteemed a <hi>Command of Councel,</hi> as to this dayly Self-Diſcuſſion; a <hi>Councel</hi> of great conſequence and neceſſity, and fit to be punctually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all Spiritual perſons, who deſire to diſcern the true State and Condition of their own Interiours, to regulate their Lives accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of God and of Reaſon, to preſerve themſelves from Blindneſs, Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and thoſe multitudes of dangerous Crimes, which Self-negligence, careleſneſs, heedleſneſs infallibly draws upon them: <hi>A Councel,</hi> which all the holy Fathers have particularly recommended to their Childrens
<pb facs="tcp:32486:34"/> practiſe; which all Gods Servants have carefully performed, (ſome <hi>Twice,</hi> ſome <hi>Thrice,</hi> others <hi>Oftner,</hi> all <hi>Once</hi> a day;) and without <hi>which,</hi> tis almoſt impoſſible for poor Man, <hi>(who is toſſed too and fro, like Autumn leaves, with the Winds of Inconſtancy,)</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever long in his Virtuous enterpriſes, Pious purpoſes, and holy Reſolutions.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And to deſcend now to the particulars of this Evening Exerciſe. The <hi>Firſt thing</hi> you are to do <hi>(O devout Chriſtian!)</hi> having recollected your ſelf in ſome place of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Is to render humble and <hi>hearty Thanks</hi> to the Divine Majeſty for all Favours, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Benefits, beſtow'd on you generally in your whol life-time, and particularly <hi>that preſent Day:</hi> Benefits which his boundleſs Goodneſs dayly Renews by ſtill continuing them. And how particularly his Paternal Affection, Compaſſion, and Providence have appeared in your behalf, even in the divers Occaſions and Dangers of this now <hi>paſt</hi> Day; your Eyes (if they will only open) cannot but admiringly behold. Now, ſince he looks for no other return for his Bounty, than a bare Gratitude, which will coſt thee Nothing; Wilt thou refuſe, <hi>O Creature</hi> to thy Creator! Wilt thou deny, <hi>O Chriſtian</hi> to thy Redeemer! one dayly Act of thy Memory, one dayly Reſentment of thy
<pb facs="tcp:32486:34"/> Heart, one dayly Acknowledgment of thy Tongue, for his dayly continued Love and Liberality.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>next place,</hi> you are to begg <hi>Light</hi> to diſcern, and <hi>Ayd</hi> to correct ſuch Crimes as you have that day committed. For how can you Hope without the help of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Light, to perceive the many faults, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, omiſſions, which your Frailty, your Raſhneſs, your Indiſcretion, your Proneſs to evil, your Perverſe cuſtoms, have drawn upon your Thoughts, your Deſires, your Diſcourſes, your Actions, (amongſt ſo many Objects, Occaſions, Aſſaults;) either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt his Divine Will and Precepts, or (at leaſt) contrary to his Love and Liking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> proceed to the particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of your Conſcience, upon thoſe four Points, preſcribed by <hi>St Bernard:</hi> [1.] How much have you advanced forwards, or gon backwards in the way of Virtue and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! [2.] What you are in your Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, what in your Affections? [3.] How like you are to your Saviour, how unlike. [4.] How nearly you are united to him, or how far diſtant you are from him. Then reflect briefly upon the Companies, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, Objects, Affairs of the paſt Day; Conſidering what Paſſions, what Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, what Omiſſions, what Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb facs="tcp:32486:35"/> what expence of time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here the more Spiritual perſons may fitly make uſe of St. <hi>Leo's method:</hi> Let every Chriſtian (ſays he) ſift and ſound his Conſcience, in this Manner: [1.] Whether the Peace, profferr'd to all by our Saviour, find's a Reſting place in his Heart. [2.] Whether any Carnal Concupiſence impugn's the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes of his Soul. [3.] Whether he hates mean and humble things, and fancies ſublime and high matters. [4.] Whether the inordinate deſire of Gain, or a Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of encreaſing his temporal means, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, honours, worldly glory and eſteem tranſports him. [5.] Finally, whether hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Neighbours Proſperity provokes him to Envy, or his Enemies Calamity excites him to Joy and gladneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If</hi> in your Examination, you have taken notice of any <hi>Mortal Crime;</hi> Be ſure to confound your ſelf preſently in your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors preſence, by an humble acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your ſtrange Malice, Ingratitude, Frailty: Look upon the diſmal, inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, interminable <hi>torments of Hell,</hi> which you have deſerved even now at this very inſtant: Then praiſe and magnify the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Mercy,</hi> which permitted not the Earth to ſwallow you, as <hi>Dathan and Abiron;</hi> or the Waves to ingulph you, as <hi>Pharao with
<pb facs="tcp:32486:35"/> his Egyptian Army;</hi> or Fire to conſume you as <hi>Sodom and Gomorra;</hi> or his Sword to cut you off, as the rebellious <hi>crew in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> or his Breath to blaſt you with ſodain Death, <hi>as Ananias and Saphira;</hi> or ſome other Inſtrument of his ſevere Juſtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his Injury, raze you from off the earths Surface, and caſt you headlong into the place which is only proper and therefore prepared to receive ſuch ungrateful and perverſe Wretches; as <hi>divers Others,</hi> who have been Death-ſtruck in the very height of their ſinful fact, and hurried away to Hell, before they had perfected their begun impiety.</p>
            <p>And why is this favourable <hi>delay</hi> of the Divine Juſtice afforded you, <hi>(O undeſerving Wretch!)</hi> but to give you time to call upon his Mercy? Call therefore, (Poor and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable Criminal!) <hi>Call inſtantly</hi> upon the Divine Clemency: <hi>Petition</hi> him preſently for a Pardon: <hi>Purpoſe</hi> ſeriouſly to Correct, ſpeedily to Confeſs, willingly to Satisfy for your Tranſgreſſion: And ſuffer not, <hi>O Chriſtian!</hi> ſuffer not any <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> (which is not abſolutly Renounc'd, Revok'd, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd, by a Retractation of your Will,) to harbour in your Heart, to neſtle in your Soul, and to ſleep one whol Night with you in your Boſom. For ſince you dread to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a <hi>Serpent</hi> for your Bedfellow; how
<pb facs="tcp:32486:36"/> dare you ſleep ſecurely, having this horrid <hi>Serpent,</hi> not with you, but within you; not in your Bed, but in your Breaſt, to deſtroy your Soul by an eternal Death and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if your ſleeping Body ſhould be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by a temporal Death and Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And have not many Sinners been ſo ſerv'd? Ah! my Friend! <hi>That which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to One, may happen to any One, and may juſtly be dreaded by every One.</hi> In matters of ſuch moment, where the loſs (if it happens) is irreparable, <hi>Precaution</hi> is neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the <hi>Danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Act of Contrition muſt not have the Fear of your own eternal Puniſhment, and the Dread of Hell-fire, for its only <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi> This is too mean a Motive for your Sorrow, and unſufficient for your Salvation. You are to take the riſe of your Grief from a more glorious Origin, the Conſideration of the heavenly <hi>Felicity,</hi> whereof this Sin of yours hath eternally depriv'd you, unleſs your true and timely Repentance re-inſtates you. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers Violence.</hi> Your Sorrow, O Sinner! muſt force your paſſage thither, and your Sighs and Tears muſt make a Breach for your entrance. Neither muſt you yet ſtay here, but ſoare higher than Heaven it ſelf, elevating your afflicted Spirit, even to the <hi>Throne of the
<pb facs="tcp:32486:36"/> Divine Majeſty</hi> offended. Yes <hi>O penitent Soul!</hi> The Divine Goodneſs offended is the only pure Motive, and ought to be the prime Object of your <hi>Sorrow and Contrition. O my Father,</hi> (ſaid the Repentant Prodigal,) <hi>I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in your preſence:</hi> He ſays not, <hi>I am worthy of your Puniſhment,</hi> unworthy of your Inheritance; but <hi>I have offended you,</hi> and injur'd your Goodneſs. The conſideration of having offended his loving Father, more lively pierces his Soul, than the fear of Puniſhment, or the loſs of his Portion.</p>
            <p>To be ſorry for our Sins, by reaſon of the <hi>incurr'd Puniſhment,</hi> is a Slaves property: by reaſon of the <hi>loſt reward,</hi> is the part of a Mercenary; by reaſon of <hi>Gods Goodneſs,</hi> is a loving Child's Duty. The <hi>Slave</hi> ſhunns Blows; the <hi>Mercenary</hi> ſeeks for Gain, the <hi>Child</hi> ſhews his Duty: The <hi>firſt</hi> is an act of Conſtraint, the <hi>next</hi> of Covetouſneſs, the <hi>laſt</hi> of Love. The <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is indeed to be dreaded, and the <hi>Reward</hi> is to be deſired, but Gods <hi>Love</hi> is chiefly to be regarded. His Love ſhould be mans <hi>only Motive,</hi> becauſe Himſelf is the <hi>only Object</hi> which deſeru's all his Affection; the <hi>only Good</hi> which can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh his capacious Heart; the <hi>only worthy</hi> to draw us, and the <hi>only able</hi> to ſatisfy us; the <hi>only Center</hi> whether we are to ſtear our Courſe, and the <hi>only End</hi> which can termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb facs="tcp:32486:37"/> it. Finally, 'tis <hi>He only</hi> who is our All in All, our Perfection, or Crown, our eternal Felicity.</p>
            <p>Behold, <hi>(Devout Chriſtians!)</hi> the true means, whereby you may be evermore ready for the Time, <hi>which is always ready for you,</hi> and may ſteal upon you when you leaſt think of it, unleſs you dayly think of it. God give us all his Grace, to practiſe well theſe pious Inſtructions, and to husband wiſely the <hi>precious Time</hi> he lends us; that ſo the <hi>Time</hi> wherewith he threatens us, may not ſurpriſe us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Time,</hi> (ſays he to you all his loving &amp; beloved Children,) <hi>is always ready;</hi> Death ſtill attends at your doors, but where or when it will enter and ſeize upon you, you know not. It is therefore your part to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it every day and in every place; and to make ſo good uſe of your Time <hi>here,</hi> as that you may <hi>hereafter</hi> (through my aſſiſting and proferr'd Grace,) come to the Eternity of my promiſed and prepared <hi>Glory.</hi> To which lead and conduct us all, the eternally Bleſſed Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>

                     <p>O my ſtrange Frailty, Malice, Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude! Whence is it that thou (my juſtly irritated Creator!) commandedſt not the Earth inſtantly to ſwallow me, or Fire from Heaven to conſume me, or thy extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Angel to cut me off?</p>
                     <p>Whence is it, that thou withheldſt thy breath from blaſting me, (in the very height of my ſinfull action) with ſudden death; or that thou ſent'ſt not ſome of thy inſtruments of Juſtice, to revenge this horrid injury, by razing me from off the Earth's ſurface, and hurrying me head-long into the diſmal, inexplicable, interminable torments of Hell; being the place, which is only proper (and therefore prepar'd) to receive ſuch ungratefull, ungracious, and perverſe wretches.</p>
                     <p>And why is this favourable delay of thy divine Juſtice, afforded me, (O my patient and compaſſionate Lord God!) but only to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32486:47"/> give me time to recall my ſelf from my wickedneſs, and to call upon thy Mercy and Goodneſs?</p>
                     <p>Behold, (O my Creator!) I call, I cry, I come to thee, as a poor, wretched, miſerable Criminal! I call to thee for Pity, I cry to thee for Mercy, I come to thee for Pardon: And I reſolve, purpoſe, and promiſe, (by the aſſiſtance of thy Grace) ſeriouſly to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, ſpeedily to confeſs, and willingly to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for what is amiſs in me.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore, even for thy own ſake, (O compaſſionate Father!) pity, relieve, and receive thy poor repenting, and returning Prodigal: who even for thy own and only ſake, heartily deteſts all his ſins, ſincerely promiſes his amendment, and humbly craves thy pardon.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>When your darknrſs, dryneſs, dulneſs, temptations, or diſtractions, will permit you to do (as it were) nothing in Prayer: You are not therefore to be diſmay'd, or deſiſt from keeping on in your courſe at ſet and ordinary ſeaſons: But call to mind theſe three points with faithful diligence, reſignation, and indifferency.</hi>

                     <p>I alſo moſt gratefully confeſs, that <hi>Faith</hi> is a gratuite gift of thy meer mercy, and gracious bounty; which alone moved thee to infuſe it into my undeſerving ſoul in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, O love! O liberality!</p>
                     <p>But, ah my unfaithfulneſs! how poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have I performed my then made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick promiſe and profeſſion? Alas, my diſloyal Soul! Thou haſt not liv'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Faith</hi>'s Laws; thou haſt little lov'd thy Lord, leſs thy Neighbour, and leaſt of all thine own ſelf: Thou haſt ſcarcely dreaded thy ſupreme Creator as thy ſevere Judg, much leſs honour'd, ſerv'd, and obey'd him as thy ſweet Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thy <hi>Faith</hi> hath been hitherto dead, and thy barren tree hath not yet budded

                     <p>O pious and potent Lord! Curſe not preſently this fruitleſs fig-tree, leſt it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wither away into nothing! O cut me not yet off, nor caſt me ſuddenly into the fire, as I have moſt juſtly deſerved, for having thus long poſſeſs'd a place in thy Garden, without any return of profit to thee my heavenly Planter! O ſpare me one year longer, (Divine Husbandman!) digg about me, and refreſh my drineſs with the ſweet ſtreams of thy infinite mercy, that I may ſpring forth into fruitfull works, worthy my <hi>Faith</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                     <p>Quicken, renew, revive, (O bountifull Lord!) thine own gracious gift of <hi>Faith</hi> in my Soul, which is dulled, deaded, and almoſt deſtroy'd and choak'd up, with the venomous weeds of my wilfull ſin and negligence! O give me a freſh ſupply of celeſtial light and ſtrength, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able my poor Soul to pour forth her ſelf here in thy Divine preſence; receive thy now repenting and returning child, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don mercifully his paſt diſloyalties; and graciouſly accept theſe hearty proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his moſt ſincere fidelity for the future.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32486:75"/> ground-work of my ſalvation, the only Eye by which I can view heaven through this veil of mortality, the root of all that is truly good, deſirable, amiable; and yet this ſo neceſſary a good, (O eternal Goodneſs!) is thy free gift: I will inſtantly beg it of thy bounty, and never ceaſe crying out, in imitation of thy Apoſtles; <hi>Lord, encreaſe my Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Since the want of this lively and active <hi>Faith,</hi> in ſuch things as concern thy divine honour, (O dread Soveraign!) and my own happineſs, is the chief cauſe that I have paſſed and loſt ſo many years, days, and hours of my ſhort life, without making any progreſs in thy love, or profit in virtue: My ſoul ſhall henceforth inhabit Heaven; my ſpirit ſhall be no longer link'd to theſe ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects, but ſhall look upon things to come, as if they were preſent truths: Ah World! what art thou to me, who am made for an Eternity? O Earth! how I loath thee, when I behold Heaven!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Since my <hi>Faith</hi> is thus ſetled, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience thus quieted, my mind thus reſolved upon ſuch evident grounds, ſuch infallible Principles; Let Hell vomit out all its malice by hereticks mouths againſt theſe my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents; Let all the dead ariſe from their graves, to tell me I am deceived; Let the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32486:75"/> Angels and Saints deſcend from heaven to Evangelize a new doctrine; Let all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans upon Earth revolt againſt this, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a contrary belief: I will ſtill remain ſtedfaſt in my choice, and firm in my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: not for the miracles which have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd me, and marks of truth, which have ſeal'd my ſecurity, and thy Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: but becauſe thou (my Lord!) who haſt thus illuminated my ſoul with the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural light of <hi>Faith,</hi> which thy Church teacheth me, art the Truth it ſelf, and canſt not poſſibly deceive me.</p>
                     <p>Lord! I believe thy ſelf, and thy ſacred Church: This is the ſum of my belief: This is my preſent profeſſion and proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before heaven and earth: Here I live, here I will die: Supply my defects, (O indeficient fountain of goodneſs!) and ſtrengthen this my <hi>Faith</hi> by thy efficacious Grace, even to the laſt gaſp. <hi>I believe in God, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THou only, (O my bleſſed Creator) canſt bound my deſires; Ah! what content can I take in the beſt of thy Creatures: Thou haſt made my heart for thy ſelf; and till it reſts in thee, its true Center, it remains to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unſatisfied. O worldly glories! what are you but poor and periſhing trifles; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to my Gods eſſential goodneſs?</p>
                     <p>Grant therefore, O my God! that I may ſo love all thy creatures, and make ſuch uſe of all temporalities; that my hopes may never be unfaſtned from thee, my final and eternal happineſs! Let me not reſt in them as ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, nor purſue them as principal, ſince they are too vain and uncertain, too unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and unworthy to quiet and content my
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:32486:83"/> Soul, which aims at a higher mark, and hopes one day to behold thy aimable countenance more clearly than through Faiths glaſs, to contemplate thy lovely perfections without laſſitude, to enter into thy eternal Paradiſe, and be there ſweetly raviſhed with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil'd rarities of thy Divinity.</p>
                     <p>Thou Lord! art the only Author of all my Good, and therefore the main object of all my Hope: Yet ſince thy paternal piety and providence hath allotted ſecond and leſs principal cauſes to be aſſiſtants to me, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the deſired poſſeſſion of theſe prime prerogatives, I will place alſo, in the ſacred <hi>Humanity</hi> of my Redeemer, in the powerful interceſſion of the <hi>Mother-Virgin,</hi> in the ſuffrages of the heavenly <hi>Angels</hi> and holy <hi>Saints,</hi> ſo much Confidence; as may not (in the leaſt meaſure) hinder, diſtract, or divert my full Hope from thy ſelf, who art my ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and only ſoveraign object.</p>
                     <p>And now, my God! the only deſired of my Soul! behold, I offer up unto thee all theſe acts of my <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Confidence:</hi> And here again I moſt humbly acknowledg, that thou haſt provided, both for my Body, and Soul in ſo convenient a manner, as no other but thy ſelf (O increated Wiſdom!) could have effected: To thee then, I commit my ſelf and all that concerns me to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32486:83"/> of now and ever, as ſhall be moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to thy divine honour, and moſt conform to thy eternal and equitable diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>For ſince thy power, knowledg, and goodneſs, are infinit; what hurt can befal him, or what enemy harm him, who lives ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in thy ſacred friendſhip, and is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed under the wings of thy Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
                     <p>For the future, (O my good and gracious Soveraign!) I will grave on the door of my mouth and heart, <hi>Dominus providebit;</hi> Our Lord will provide: Fear not, my ſoul! Our Lord governs thee, nothing can be wanting to thee: <hi>God is for us, who dare be against us?</hi> He placeth us neer himſelf, let who will ſtretch their hands againſt us. Let Man, and Devil, earth and Hell, fight againſt us; Thou Lord, art my Captain, my comfort, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Thou, O JESU! art my victory, my glory, my crown, and my contentment; Thou O Chriſt! art my hope, my help, my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I will henceforth dread nothing, but to diſpleaſe thee, nor deſire any thing, but to love thee: I will reſt quiet, and confident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy fatherly care, and powerful protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; come ſickneſs or health, welcom dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or light, joy or ſorrow, plenty or penury, friend or foe, life or death, Heaven or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Time or Eternity.</p>

                     <p>THou (O moſt amiable Lord God!) <hi>art Charity, and he that remains in Charity, lives in thee, and thou in him:</hi> O divine Love! O happy life! Lord give me this love, that I may thus live: draw my will powerfully by thy grace, to love thy goodneſſes, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and glories, with a ſupernatural liking of them for thine own ſake.</p>
                     <p>Habituate and diſpoſe me thy poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (O Omnipotent Creator!) to form ſweet Acts of thy ſacred love; direct me to faſten all my affections to thy only intereſts; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy in me all ſelfiſhneſs; cancel all diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſments to created objects; and raiſe up my ſoul to a ſincere deſire, that thou alone ſhouldſt poſſeſs all ſuch perfections, as are to thy ſelf moſt proper and convenient.</p>
                     <p>I am therfore moſt highly pleaſed, moſt heartily glad, and I moſt humbly congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32486:84"/> thee (O my Lord!) that thou art even all that which thou art: and that thou enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thine own eternal Prerogatives, thy Unity of Eſſence, thy Trinity of ſubſiſtences, thy Infinity of attributes, thy Power, Wiſdom, Bounty, Beatitude, Greatneſs, Glory, and all other the unconceivable goods and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons flowing from thy divine Nature, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to thy eternal Being.</p>
                     <p>O the inſcrutable and immenſe perfections of my God! how glad is my ſoul, that thou canſt not be fully comprehended, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known by any created underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh and deſire (Dear Lord!) the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thy moſt juſt Commandments; the augmentation of thy honour, praiſe, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and all other appurtinances to thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or relatives to thy greatneſs, with all the affections which can poſſibly be conceived by thy weak creatures capacity.</p>
                     <p>O my Lord! I will and deſire all this for thine own ſelfs ſake, with a love of perfect liking, benevolence, and congratulation for thy good; without the leaſt touch of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, or proper intereſt.</p>
                     <p>O the joy and jubily of my heart, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thee (the mighty Monark of heaven and earth!) to be in thy ſelf and of thy ſelf, ſo great, ſo happy, ſo rich, ſo glorious! Oh! how ardent are my wiſhes that all things

                     <p>O that thy glory were infinitly greater in heaven and earth! O that all created liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were more perfectly addicted to thy Love, and all Spirits had a clearer knowledg of thy incomparable goodneſs, excellency and amability! And yet, how highly doth it pleaſe me, that all that which the beſt of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can endeavour to do for thy Love and Service, is ſo far inferiour to thy eſſential worth and dignity?</p>
                     <p>Live my dread Soveraign! Be thou what thou art, Infinit, Eternal, Incomprehenſible! Remain (O powerful Emperour of the whol univerſe!) for ever exalted upon the Throne of thine own greatneſſes and glories: I love thee in them all, and each of them in thee, as if I were all one with thee, they all mine own, and I equally concern'd in them all.</p>

                     <p>I Love all things, O my Lord, in thee and for thee. Thy Creatures are the products of thy power; they are ſo many bright

                     <p>My Neighbour is yet a neerer ſhadow of thy goodneſs, (O divine Creator!) a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier Image of thy greatneſs, thy own adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive child, bought at the dear purchaſe of thy precious bloud, and deſigned to be partaker of thy heavenly Paradiſe.</p>
                     <p>O ſhall it ever enter into my heart, to hate or offend any one of theſe thy lovely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Is it poſſible I can truly love thee (My Lord and my God!) and loath that ſoul, which is ſtamp'd with thy ſacred ſimilitude, intended for thy greateſt glory, and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to chant forth thy eternal praiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the bleſſed quires of Saints &amp; Angels? Ah! how can that body, which ſhal be one day reſuſcitated to heavenly bliſs, imbelliſht with glorious dowries of immortallity, be now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious unto me, aiming at the like happineſs?</p>
                     <p>No, my Lord! I love my Neighbours moſt truly, tenderly, particularly, in thee and for thee: I will henceforth cheriſh them all for thy ſake, and contract a durable peace with them: Be they vicious, envious, ugly, ulcerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they are ſtill my fellow Brethren, and thy lovely creatures, and therefore fit objects of

                     <p>And now, O my Lord and Lover! reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Charity upon my own Soul; I moſt humbly beſeech thee, that I may henceforth ſo truly love my own eternal welfare, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more to adventure the loſs of thy grace, by the admittance of wilful ſin.</p>
                     <p>Imprint, O my God, this important reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with indelible characters in my heart: Never to ſin wilfully in thy ſight, were it to ſave the whol World, or to gain Heaven to a million of ſouls; much leſs to pleaſe any earthly friend, or purchaſe any temporal commodity: Ah, unequal chang!

                     <p>THou haſt no where expreſly enjoyned me to love my Self (O great Maſter of Perfection!) becauſe to love thee, ſeek thee, ſerve thee, perfectly, purely, punctually, is to love my Self ſolidly, truly, unfainedly.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:32486:86"/> Theſe loves, O my Soul! cannot be the leaſt ſeparated: thou loveſt thy Self really, when thou loveſt thy God intirely; thou hateſt thy Self abſolutly, when thy love hath not his goodneſs for its object. Doſt thou not then hate thy Self, when thou hazardeſt thine own Salvation? Doſt thou love thy Self, when by voluntary ſin thou leav'ſt thy ſelf in danger of eternal Death and Damnation? Doſt thou love thy Body, when thou pamper'ſt it, and permitteſt ſuch pleaſures, as muſt be paid with perpetual puniſhments? O falſ, feigned, and fooliſh affection, which tends to thy own ruine and deſtruction! No my Lord! 'tis thy only Love, which is the true model of Self-love. O let masked and miſtaken Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never more betray me; let me love my ſelf in loving thee, ſerving thee, obeying thee, renouncing all proper contentment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring thy only ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If you love me,</hi> (ſaith the Lord of Love) <hi>you will keep my Laws; and if you fulfil my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, you are my friends:</hi> O ſublime Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! to contract friendſhip and familiarity with the King of Glory!

After all your pains, what is your pay at the beſt, but a little pelf, a puff of honour, a name at Court, a favour from a King, a friendſhip with an Emperour: and what is in all theſe, that is not frail and full of danger? Ah! how long will you ſweat in theſe unſure and unſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſuits? when as to be Gods friend and favorite, I am ſo (if I will) even at this very inſtant. O the heavenly prerogative of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Charity!</p>
                     <p>'Tis thou alone (O glorious Charity!) which giveſt unto Virtues their true form, life, value, worth, denomination and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince thou guideſt them all unto God, who is the end whereto they are to be referred, and to his glory, for which they are to be practiſed, to make them truly Virtues.</p>

All I ſhall do, think, ſpeak, during the whol reſidue of my days, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to thy glory: I give up tree, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit, all, to this only end, by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32486:87"/> an entire, irrevocable, and eternal Donation: Whatſoever ſhall hereafter happen contrary to this my reſolution, I here proteſt in thy preſence, (O my God!) to be a meer ſurpriſal, and altogether involuntary; And therfore (now for then) utterly diſavow it; and chuſe thee, embrace thee, aim at thee (O my bleſſed Creator!) as the final period of all my Faith, Hope, Love, Actions, Intentions and Pretenſions whatſoever.</p>

                     <p>Encourage me (O my God!) to climb up the ſeveral ſteps of thy heavenly Charity: O let the ſame merciful goodneſs, which hath given it a <hi>beginning</hi> in my heart, augment it and bring it to its full growth and <hi>perfection:</hi> As I have for thy love rooted out all <hi>affection to ſin,</hi> aſſiſt me now to implant Virtues in my Souls garden, that thou may'ſt finally <hi>repoſe in it, (during the mid-day heat of my affection)</hi> thus fitted up and prepar'd for thy deſired Preſence.</p>

                        <p>Attrition, <hi>is (of it ſelf) inſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon, and therefore it must be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a Sacramental</hi> Confeſſion, <hi>to render it effectual for the Remiſſion of ſins, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the divine Grace and Friendſhip.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Contrition, <hi>is ſo Excellent, that</hi> S.

It is ſo</hi> eaſy, <hi>that</hi> a Moment may conceive it, an Inſtant may produce it; <hi>For neither the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, (ſays</hi> S.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:32486:117"/> Penitent. Finally, it is ſo</hi> Profitable, <hi>that (ſays the ſame Saint) it not only obtains</hi> Pardon for paſt offences, but gains alſo a future Crown of glory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But this perfect</hi> Contrition, <hi>muſt proceed</hi> [1.] <hi>from a motive of the Love of God, and not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſervil Fear: As when a Child having offended his Father, grieves not ſo much for fear of being diſinherited, as for having been diſloyal and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to ſo loving and beloved a Parent.</hi> [2] <hi>It muſt be accompanied with an inward, ſincere and hearty Deteſtation of the Crime, like that of the Prophet</hi> David, <hi>and of the Apoſtle S.</hi> Peter; <hi>and not only an outward, verbal and lip-lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, like that of</hi> Antiochus <hi>and</hi> Eſau. <hi>And</hi> [3] <hi>It muſt be joyned with a firm Reſolution of future Amendment.</hi>

What will it ſerve thee to deteſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſs
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:32486:117"/> if thou continueſt in Covetouſneſs. [3] <hi>They must precede (if not the Confeſſion,) at least the Abſolution; for they being (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) of the Eſſence of the Sacrament of</hi> Penance, <hi>muſt neceſſarily go before the end thereof, which is the</hi> Abſolution. [4] <hi>There needs no vocal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this Sorrow, Deteſtation and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for an inward feeling and conception thereof in the Soul abundantly ſufficeth.</hi> [5] <hi>Neither is it neceſſary to conceive as many Sorrows, or form as many acts of Deteſtation, and Reſolution, as you have committed Sins; for one only general, ſincere, and hearty Sorrow;</hi> one <hi>Deteſtation of all that is oppoſite to the divine love and liking;</hi> one <hi>Reſolution of amendment, includes all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and Future crimes and offences.</hi>

               </head>
               <div type="introduction">
                  <head>General Advertiſements concerning General Confeſſions.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe motive, which <hi>obliges</hi> all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, (who are deſirous to perform their Duty, and ſettle their ſouls in the ſtate of Grace) to make a General Confeſſion, is only this:</p>
                  <p>When upon juſt and rational Grounds, (and not out of an erroneous or ſcrupulous Underſtanding) they doubt of the Validity of any of their former Confeſſions; by reaſon-of ſome eſſential Defect, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them.</p>
                  <p>The eſſential Defects, are [1.] Want of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient power and juriſdiction in the Prieſt to whom their Confeſſions were made: Or, if he were ſo ignorant, ſo deaf, ſo <hi>drunk, &amp;c.</hi> as that probably he did not hear the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, or not rightly give the Abſolution. [2.] Want of Contrition in the Penitent, (or of ſo much Sorrow, as was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly neceſſary with the Sacrament:) or
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:32486:138"/> want of a ſufficient purpoſe of amendment. [3.] Want of Integrity in the Confeſſion; when the Penitent wittingly and willingly concealed any mortal Sin. In which caſes, it is abſolutely neceſſary to reiterate, not only ſuch Confeſſions; but all that were made ſince any ſuch committed Error.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for other motives, (of Devotion and not of Obligation) inducing zealous Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to make General, or Annual Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: they are to be judg'd of, by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Ghoſtly Father, and his <hi>dictamen</hi> and counſel is therein to be followed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Penitent therefore, who is deſirous to make an exact general Confeſsion: (either as neceſsitated thereto, by reaſon of ſome Eſſential Defect crept into his former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions; or adviſed thereto by his Ghoſtly Father:) May do well (for his more order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeding, and to avoid trouble, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs and Confuſion) to divide his whole life into three or four eſtates, or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The <hi>firſt,</hi> from the time he had the uſe of reaſon, to the time of his firſt Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or, (If he have been brought up in Hereſie,) till the time of his Converſion to the Catholick Faith. The <hi>Second,</hi> From that firſt Communion or Converſion, till the time of his Marriage, or of his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Religion, or of his undertaking ſuch an
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:32486:138"/> office, trade, employment, or of his being made Prieſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>third,</hi> From that time, till he made his laſt exact General Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The <hi>fourth,</hi> From that time till this preſent day.</p>
                  <p>Where note, That if the Penitent well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members to have made good and ſincere Confeſsions, till he came to ſuch an Age: or, that about ten or twenty years paſt, or at ſuch a time, be made an exact General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion; He is in no ſort obliged to begin his Examination of Conſcience any higher, than preciſely from ſuch time as he doubts of the validity of his Confeſsions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Having thus divided his life: He muſt apply himſelf to conſider the Places where he liv'd; the Perſons with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed; and what was the chief part of his charge, office, employment, and buſineſs: That ſo he may finde out (that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the main matter and greateſt difficulty in the making an exact General Confeſsion; to wit,) The number of his ſins in their ſeveral kinds and ſpecies.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If he hath been ſo habituated to ſome one or more particular ſins, as that he daily and cuſtomarily committed them: it ſuffices to declare, that he ſo long time, for ſo many years, or months, wallowed therein.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the Cuſtom was not ſo continual,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:32486:139"/> nor the Acts ſo frequent; It ſuffices to ſay, That he was given to ſuch a Sin, for ſo long a time, during which, he fell each month, or each week ſo often.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Becauſe the frailty of mens Memory is ſo great, that they can ſcarcely give in the particular number of their Sins; It ſuffices to ſay, I have fallen into ſuch a Sin ſo many times, to wit 40. or 50. times, or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If one hath been formerly an Heretick, It is ſufficient to ſay, I continued ſo long in ſuch an Hereſie, to wit a <hi>Proteſtant, Puritan,</hi> &amp;c. reſiſting Gods Grace and Call, <hi>&amp;c</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecifying ſuch other Crimes as are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from hereſie, as not having during that time obſerv'd the Faſts, Feaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he hath alſo committed other Crimes, which are againſt the common laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Chriſtianity, which muſt be ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. As for the time which is requiſite for the Examination of Conſcience, in order to a General Confeſsion; it muſt be ſo much as is ſufficient, according to the Judgment of a prudent and diſcreet man, (the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents dexterity being conſidered.)</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Let ſuch over-ſcrupulous Penitents, as torment themſelves, &amp; trouble their Ghoſtly Fathers with long and unneceſſary relations of the circumſtances of their Sins, reſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:32486:139"/> and aſſured: That it is (morally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) impoſsible, for the greateſt Sinner in the world, to have committed any Crime, which is not either expreſſed or intimated in this following Catalogue: Let them therefore ſatisfie themſelves to have deliberatly and impartially examin'd themſelves upon theſe points) and Confes'd ſuch Sins accordingly, wherein they found themſelves culpable; adding briefly ſuch only eſſential Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as may alter the ſpecies of the crime.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Circumſtances ſomtimes make that a Mortal Sin, which of its own nature is only Venial. As if you take away a ſmall thing from another, to the end he ſhould bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme God. Somtimes they change the Species of the Sins: as Theft committed in the Church is Sacriledg. Somtimes they multiply the Sins: as to eat fleſh upon a Friday in Leat. Somtimes they bring an
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:32486:151"/> Excommunication upon you, beſides the Sin; as to ſtrike a Prieſt. Somtimes they exceedingly Aggravate the Sin; as to be forſworn upon a Sunday: or, For a Prieſt to be forſworn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>You are not to reflect any more upon your paſt ſins: (except only by way of a general deteſtation of them all:) but to perſwade

                  <p n="3">3. Scrupulous Penitents are not bound to make a new Confeſſion, (after this General one) of any ſin whatſoever; unleſs they can poſitively ſwear, that they committed it, and that they did not Confeſs it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And every Penitent ought to ſubmit his judgement, (in this point of Confeſſing again, or not Confeſſing) to the dictamen of his Ghoſtly Father, (ſuppoſing he is one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally held to be ſufficiently diſcreet, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and experienc'd:) For in this caſe to believe and obey him, is an act both of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian virtue and prudence; and 'tis impoſſible, that God (who is goodneſs it ſelf, and who hath ſaid, He that hears you, hears me,) ſhould damn any one for ſuch an omiſſion.</p>

                  <p>Give me pardon <hi>(O merciful Maker!)</hi> for my paſt Sins and Impieties; and grace to amend for the future: And though I am moſt unworthy to have my Prayers heard, or my Petition granted; becauſe I am ſo enormous an offender: yet <hi>(O merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!)</hi> look upon thy meek Son Jeſus, whoſe precious Bloud I preſent unto thee; And beg for his dear ſake, that thou wilt be propitious to me, a wretched Sinner.</p>

I have, (alas!

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:32486:231"/> your Creatures by the rule of Neceſſity, I have followed the law of Senſuality: Is it not then moſt juſt I ſhould at laſt loſe the goods I ſo long abuſed? Yes, <hi>O my Lord!</hi> and you deal favourably with your rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Servant, if the pains I now ſuffer may ſerve to expiate the future puniſhments my Sins have deſerved. Give me therefore, <hi>O my Gracious Soveraign!</hi> the Spirit of perfect Penance, that I may zealouſly riſe up againſt my ſelf to revenge your offended Juſtice; and that to appeaſe and and ſatisfie it, I may ſuffer my preſent Sickneſs, not only with patience, but with pleaſure, alacritie, and gratitude. Strike me, <hi>O my God!</hi> Scourge me, burn me, wound me, cut me, and kill my Body, ſo you pardon my Sins, and ſpare my Soul in Eternity, In hope of which happineſs, all Sufferings ſhall ſeem ſweet to me, as proceeding from your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal hands; and I here diſavow all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of complaint, which the violence of my Diſeaſe may hereafter draw from my Tongue, but not from my Heart; which is wholly reſign'd to my dear Lord's will and pleaſure. Nor will I care to be informed how long I muſt lie languiſhing in this my Infirmity, or whether Death ſhall in this battle be defeated, or become victorious over my life: No, <hi>my Lord!</hi> I abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:32486:231"/> leave the diſpoſal of my Body, Soul, and all that concerns me, to thy divin Will and Pleaſure; and deſire nothing, as to my life and death, but that the ſhort remainder of my life may be ſpent in loving thee, ſerving thee, and ſuffering for thee; and that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou ſhalt ſend death to cut its thread, my Soul may be found ready prepared for her happy eternitie.

                     <head>The firſt profit is; That remembring theſe departed Souls, they can hardly forget their own approaching Death: and conſequently will be moved to make ſome timely prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for that great action, whereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends their whole Eternity.</head>
                     <p>THe practiſe hereof may be reduced to theſe <hi>two Points.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Queſtion your ſelf in this ſort: Were I now preſently to depart this world upon deaths Summons: am I in a condition to appear before Gods Judgment Seat?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Habituate your ſelf in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of <hi>ſuch</hi> Acts, <hi>as</hi> you would and ſhould practiſe in the article of your Death: Taking therefore your <hi>Crucifix</hi> in your hand; ſay: Well!

All this is uncertain, I accept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>(O my Creator!)</hi> the Decree of my death, as from thy divine Juſtice; and the Uncertaintie of its execution, from thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Providence: Behold, I am readie and willing to obey thy bleſſed Ordinances, nor do I deſire to live one moment longer, than is according to thy moſt juſt will and liking.</p>
                     <p>I proteſt that I will live and dye in an abſolute conformitie to the Catholike Faith; becauſe thou, my <hi>Lord God,</hi> (who art the prime and eſſential Truth,) haſt taught and revealed it.</p>
                     <p>I Hope in the infinitie of thy goodneſs; in the fidelitie of thy promiſes, in the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:32486:268"/> immenſity of my Saviours merits: Though thou killeſt me, <hi>O my Lord,</hi> yet I will hope in thy Mercy.</p>
                     <p>I will dy in thy Love, that I may love thee <hi>(O abyſſal Ocean of all Love and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection!)</hi> for evermore.

                     <p>It grieves me, <hi>(O my God!)</hi> that I ever offended thee; becauſe thou art infinitly good: and I am content to dy; becauſe I would be freed from all future occaſions of offending thee. Wherefore I here offer thee my life, as a pledge of my Love; and I accept of Death, as a fit puniſhment of my offences.</p>
                     <p>O when will that deſired day come, in which I ſhall <hi>ſee</hi> thee <hi>(my ſweet Saviour!)</hi> face to face without any interpoſition; <hi>love</hi> thee without any interruption; <hi>praiſe</hi> thee without any imperfection?</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <p>THe <hi>Second Profit is:</hi> That conſidering the grievous pains they ſuffer; you
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:32486:269"/> will eaſily reſolve to endure your Purgatory in this world: which was the ardent deſire of S. <hi>Auguſtin;</hi> when he thus petition'd the divine Majeſty: <hi>Purge me (O Lord!) in this life, and put me here in ſuch a condition, as there may be no need hereafter of any Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Fire; that ſo I may be the ſooner united to thee, my firſt beginning, and my final end and felicity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The practiſe hereof may be reduced to theſe points following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>COnſider, that all Sin, renders us liable to puniſhment, which muſt infallibly be paid, either in this world or in the next. Now our merciful Lord ſeems to leave the choice unto our ſelves, and to preſent unto us two Purgatories:</hi> That of the next world, <hi>painful, long, fiery, devoid of all comfort and merit:</hi> That of this world, <hi>eaſie, ſhort, and full of comfort. O my Soul!</hi> which wilt thou chooſe?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Purgatory of this world conſiſts in ſatisfying Gods ſevere Juſtice for our ſins, as far forth as we are able by our <hi>own free actions:</hi> without deferring it to the end of our lives, or depending upon the charity of <hi>others. O my Soul!</hi> wert thou preſently to depart out of this world; how many years of Purgatory muſt thou expect for
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:32486:270"/> the expiation of thy many and enormous offences? Reſolve therefore to begin (even this day without any farther delay) thy Purgatory in this world, by endeavouring now to make ſatisfaction for thy ſins.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Satisfaction conſiſts in theſe <hi>Five</hi> things; which may ſerve us for as many <hi>Purgatories,</hi> to cleanſe our Souls from their Sins, and cancel the pains they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by juſtly incurred.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, To perform thoſe works which are call'd <hi>Satisfactory,</hi> to wit, <hi>Alms-deeds, Faſting, and Prayer;</hi> uniting them to the merits of our Redeemer, Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Alms deeds,</hi> ſatisfy the divine Majeſty, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him our goods of Fortune: <hi>Faſting,</hi> by conſecrating to him the goods of our Bodies: <hi>Prayer,</hi> by offering up to him the goods of our Hearts and Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Alms-deeds <hi>free us from Sin and Death; and ſuffer not a Soul to deſcend into darkneſs. They purge us and procure us mercy, and eternal life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faſting,</hi> which (under its notion) contains all ſorts of penitential actions, mor ificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and auſterities, both voluntary and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory; <hi>opens Heaven-gates unto us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Prayers <hi>appeaſe the divine Anger:</hi> and Tears <hi>extinguiſh the Fires and Flames which are prepared by Gods Juſtice, to puniſh us
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:32486:270"/> for our offences.</hi> Now the moſt efficacious Prayers are theſe: (1.) The <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist.</hi> (3.) The <hi>continual practiſe of Acts of Contrition;</hi> which ſerv'd the pious <hi>Magdalen</hi> for her Purgatory at the feet of Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, To embrace all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Croſſes, Calamities, Sickneſſes, and Loſſes of this life; as ſo many purging Fires. Thus the patient <hi>Job</hi> endur'd his Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory upon his Dunghil, and in the Fire of fervent Charity, and faithful Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which made him break forth into theſe expreſſions amidſt all his ſufferings: <hi>Our Lords Name be ever bleſſed: As he pleaſes, ſo all things come to paſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is, To practiſe heroick Acts of Virtue; as, generouſly to pardon your enemies; nobly to oblige them, who have diſobliged you; couragioſly to conquer that Paſſion, which hath moſt power in your Soul: For, the pains you take, and the violence you uſe upon theſe occaſions, will much contribute to the Satisfaction for your Sins, and ſerve you inſtead of your deſerved Purgatory.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, To perform ſuch Works of Reſtitution, Charity, and Piety, in your own perſon, and during your life-time;
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:32486:271"/> as you deſire ſhould be done at the hour of your Death: For by clearing your own Accounts, ſettling peace in your own Soul, and executing your own Teſtament; you will be exempt from the fear of ſuffering a ſevere Purgatory, through your Executors negligence.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> is, When you have perform'd all things, as your zeal to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice hath ſuggeſted unto you, To have an humble ſenſe of the no-worth and value of all your own actions and endeavours; and thereupon, To addreſs your ſelf to the undrainable treaſury of your Saviours merits, hoping to draw thence, ſufficient Water for the waſhing away of all your offences.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Five voluntary Purgatories of this World, by which if you here ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for your Sins, you may hope to avoid hereafter the neceſſary Purgatory due to them in the next World.</p>

                  <p>O <hi>Jeſu! King of Kings!</hi> to whom all power is given in heaven and earth, as a moſt juſt reward for thy moſt perfect Obedience! Thy Empire is out of the reach of rebellion, it dreads no dangers, and is free from the viciſſitudes of Fortune. Thou wanteſt neither ſpies abroad nor policies at home to ſecure thy Throne, neither war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like guards nor worldly greatneſſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thy reſpect and encreaſe thy honour; ſince whatſoever is requiſite to be the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign King of Kings, and the immortal and incomprehenſible Monarch of Heaven and Earth, is in the riches of thy own divine Being; and thy own Nature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily involves a boundleſs Juriſdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:32486:272"/>
                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>O Jeſu my Saviour!</hi> behold here proſtrate before thee, one of thy mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſubjects, offering to thy ſacred Majeſty, as to his ſoveraign King, an humble and moſt reſpectful Homage. I come, <hi>Lord!</hi> to renew that ſolemn Oath of fidelity which I took formerly in Baptiſm; and to preſent thee the Key of my Heart, hoping thou wilt vouchſafe to enter in, take full poſſeſſion, and make there thy conſtant habitation. Thou, <hi>O all-powerful King!</hi> canſt ſoon make it fit for thy own entertainment; having in this point <hi>(as in all others)</hi> an advantage over earthly Princes, to raiſe men from their dunghils, and render them worthy of their dignities: Thou, <hi>O great Monarch!</hi> chuſing <hi>Saul</hi> for the King of thy people, changedſt alſo his ſpirit; calling <hi>David</hi> from the ſheep-fold, madſt him a man according to thy own Heart; drawing the Apoſtles from their Fiſhing-employments, rendredſt them fit Preachers of thy Goſpel. Why then ſhall not I with an humble boldneſs beg thy entrance into my poor Heart; ſince I well know, it will at the ſame inſtant become a manſion worthy thy Royal Majeſty?</p>
                  <p>I am not fully ſatisfied, <hi>O my Soveraign King!</hi> in being thy faithful ſubject, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be thy Bondſlave and Vaſſal: I will therefore no longer pretend to the leaſt
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:32486:272"/> power over my ſelf, but all my future labours and endeavours ſhall be to acquire riches for thy Royal Majeſty: Yes, my will is, that every child of mine, (to wit, all my works, words and thoughts,) ſhall be hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth born in the ſame Bondage of thy Love. <hi>O my Soul!</hi> what higher honour can we have, than to live in a ſuch Slavery? <hi>O my Saviour! ſweet is thy yoak, light thy burthen,</hi> eaſie thy precepts, favourable thy fetters, pleaſing thy authority, prudent thy proceedings, paternal thy providence to them who faithfully adhere to thee. O how loving and liberal a Lord art thou to ſuch loyal ſubjects? Unhappy they who are none of this holy number; and ever mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified be thy Mercy, which hath drawn my ſoul out of my enemies clutches to enrol her thy Captive. Behold, <hi>O my bleſſed Redeemer:</hi> I acknowledg my ſelf, with much comfort and content to appertain particularly to thee in quality of an abſolute Bonds man, by this thy new right of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe: but yet, <hi>O my dread Lord and Maſter!</hi> I know not how to render thee a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave's duty, and therefore beg of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to teach me this great ſecret, and take from me that unfortunate liberty, which enables me to rebel againſt thy Royal will and pleaſure. Ah! <hi>my Lord!</hi> If thou leaveſt
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:32486:273"/> this my liberty to it's own nature; I ſhall ſoon leave off all Obedience to thy laws: I ſhall quickly, alas! trample upon thy Crown, ſleight thy Scepter, and uſe againſt thy ſelf all the goods, thy bounty hath given me: My Underſtanding will cenſure thy Myſteries, my Memory will forget thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, my Fancy will feed upon filthy Images, my Will will love what thou loatheſt, my unruly Paſſions, uncurb'd Senſes, brutiſh Appetites will all bandy againſt thy bleſſed Grace and my own Reaſon: Finally, I ſhall glory in being thy enemy, and ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Shake off then with a manly courage, this ſad and heavy yoak of Sin and Satan, and ſubmit cheerfully to that which thy Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus this day preſents unto thee: <hi>A yoak, which is ſweet and eaſie,</hi> and which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will carry together with thee.

<pb n="485" facs="tcp:32486:281"/> gave thee ſuck, to preſerve us from all Plaguy Infection, to deliver us from an unprovided Death, and to defend us from all deſtructive Accidents and Incurſions.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. O <hi>Dear Lord Jeſu!</hi> I moſt humbly beſeech thee by thoſe bitter Pains and Pangs, which thou ſuffredſt for me in thy bitter Paſſion, and particularly in the hour wherein thy Divine Soul paſſed forth of thy bleſſed Body; take pity upon my poor and ſinful Soul in her laſt Agony, and in her paſſage to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tis thou, (<hi>O Soveraign Goodneſs!</hi> who art the prime Source and dayly Preſerver of my Life; and 'tis from thee alone that I can expect the Grace of a happy Death. Thou <hi>(O Lord!)</hi> didſt not make this Death which ſeparates Soul and Body; 'twas Sin which brought it into the World; had not man ſtrayed from thy ſacred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, he had not been ſubject to this ſevere Puniſhment. But yet thy Divine Son, by enduring the Sting of Death, hath chang'd its harſh Nature, and through his means and merits, it may now be made a Sacrifice moſt pleaſing to thy Majeſty: <hi>For precious in thy ſight is the juſt mans Death,</hi> which is only a
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:32486:282"/> glorious paſſage from Time to Eternity. This is the Death I here moſt humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thy Divine bounty, as the Crown of all thy Mercies; for thou, <hi>(O Lord!)</hi> lookeſt not ſo much upon the firſt beginnings of thy Children, as upon their final End and Conſummation; and the Eternity of their Glory or Miſery, depend's upon the laſt moment of their Life. Then it is, that the Tempter tries all wayes to prevaile over the weakneſs of our ſpirit, (when 'tis bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down by the Bodies ſickneſs,) either to ſwell it up into a dangerous Preſumption, or deject it into a more dangerous Deſpair. Then it is, that all the ſinful paſſages of our life come ſwarming into our Memories, to ſtrike us with a ſad reſentment of what 'tis too late to remedy. Then it is, that the poor Soul, overwhelmed with a flood of ſorrow, cannot without thy ſtrengthing Grace, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the functions of her Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Give me therefore, <hi>O my gracious Lord God!</hi> in this paſſage, (which is ſo full of peril, and of ſo great importance,) all thoſe Chriſtian diſpoſitions, which thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Clemency give's to thy elected and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Children; that I may well perform this laſt duty of life. Let me conſider Death as the juſt puniſhment of Sin; and ſo moſt willingly receive it, to obey the Law which
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:32486:282"/> comprehend's all his race, by whom it was introduced into the World. Let me look upon my Body, as a parcel of old <hi>Adam,</hi> deſerving <hi>to return into duſt,</hi> and only fit for corruption. Let me render to thy Majeſty moſt hearty thanks for vouchſafing by Death to deliver my ſpirit from the Law of theſe corporal Members, which kept it ſo long enſlaved under the Law of Sin. Let me freely offer up to thee my life in Sacrifice, and let thy love be the Fire, not only to purifie, but alſo to ennoble this my oblation, which of it ſelf is ſo mean and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</p>
                  <p>Finally, <hi>(O Soveraign Lord of life and death!)</hi> I reſignedly leave to the conduct of thy ſacred Providence all that concerns my poor Soul's departure out of this her pilgrimage, as to the Time, the Place, the Aſſiſtants, the Conſolations, the Derelictions and whatſoever other Circumſtance. I only beg that thy holy Grace may not then aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, when all human helps muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity become uſeleſs unto me.</p>
                  <p>In the mean ſpace, let Death <hi>(O my God!)</hi> be my continual Looking-glaſs, to keep me from wilfully offending thy Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; to check my immoderate Affection to this life, which is ſo uncertain in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency and ſo certain in its miſery; and
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:32486:283"/> to mind me, that each Moment of time I live, may be the laſt, wherein I muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before thy dread tribunal, to render an account of my actions, and to receive accordingly a definitive ſentence, which muſt remain irrevocable for all Eternity.</p>

And when this prime Creature had, (Alas! ſoon after its firſt production,) loſt its original Perfection, by violating thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: thou wert graciouſly pleas'd, <hi>(O great and glorious Soveraign!)</hi> out of the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy Compaſſion towards man, this poor Criminal, to give him (as it were) a new birth, a new being, a new creation, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner far different, in a way much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, with an affection infinitly exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former.

Yes; (O my Lord and Lover!) thou becam'ſt man, even like me in all things, <hi>Sin only and ignorance excepted, which were incompatible with thy goodneſs and wiſdom, and which thou camſt to deſtroy and cancel,</hi> thus ennobling my Nature by uniting it to thy Divinity, ſanctifying it with thy Juſtice, enriching it with thy Grace, inſtructing it with thy Doctrine, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it with thy Example, reſcuing it from ſervitude, reſtoring it to its loſt title of Gods

                  <p n="5">5. But if for one only effect of your amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bounty, I feel my ſelf thus powerfully obliged to expand my Soul before thy ſacred

                  <p n="6">6. Whence is it then, <hi>(O my Love, and my Life!)</hi> that my Soul melts not away in the fires of thy ſweet Affection? How comes it to paſs, that my whole pleaſure is not in lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee intirely, ardently, indeficiently?

                  <p n="10">10. Ah! <hi>(Soveraign King of Love!)</hi> how miſerable is that Soul that lives devoid of thy dear Love! and how much more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is that Soul which having felt the ſweetneſs of thy affection falls back to her former tepidity, negligence, and ingratitude! <hi>O my Lord!</hi> Let not this miſery fall to my lot; but let me love thee ſolidly, ſincerely, preſeverantly. O Let my amorous ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fully and finally abſorpt into thy felf; Let me admire thee in thy bleſſed gifts and graces, but permit me to adore thee in thy own abyſſal, eſſential, amiable eſſence, which infinitely exceeds them. Let thy Love run ſweetly into my heart, and permit my heart to return ſweetly back by the ſame channel of Love into thy boſom, (as a Brook ſlides ſilently and ſweetly, but yet ſwiftly into its original Ocean,) to be there unrecoverably loſt in the bottomleſs depths of thy divine Affections.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>O my God, my Lord, my Love, my Life, my All!</hi> I am no longer able to endure the conſideration of thy ardent Love; without correſponding thereunto with all my heart, ſoul, and ſtrength, by the moſt zealous, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and cotinued affection, that can poſſibly be produc'd by any poor creature. O how it grieves me to have ſo long neglected this neceſſary duty! <hi>O dear Love!</hi> I moſt humbly

Behold <hi>(O the only Beloved of my Heart!)</hi> what a bold proteſtation of future fidelity in thy preſence, I have now made: hoping for thy bleſſing upon it, as an effect of thy love; but putting no value upon it, as proceeding from my ſelf, whoſe power and being are one and the ſame thing, <hi>(to wit a meer Nothing,)</hi> before thy ſupream Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: Since therefore I have as much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in thy infinite Goodneſs, as I have diſtruſt in my own Nothing, I will patiently, hopefully, reſignedly expect thy divine will and pleaſure in this and all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. <hi>O thrice welcome Will of my God!</hi> be thou fully accompliſhed in me and in all creatures for all time and Eternity.</p>
